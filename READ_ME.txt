John and Hank, 
I've included this text document to let you know about some extra nerdtastic features of my game.
There are three secret buttons, two on the far right and one on the far left of the game board,
but I'll let you find out exactly what they do on your own.
Again I hope you enjoy the game and appretiate the work I put into it, and the guts it  took for me to send this to you.
