A John and Hank Green Themed Connect4 Game
===========

##I made this my sophomore year of highschool, and no I am not embarassed! (Ok, maybe a little)

Apprently, I also sent it to them, and included this letter. Can't tell if it's adorable or creepy.

John and Hank, 
I've included this text document to let you know about some extra nerdtastic features of my game.
There are three secret buttons, two on the far right and one on the far left of the game board,
but I'll let you find out exactly what they do on your own.
Again I hope you enjoy the game and appretiate the work I put into it, and the guts it  took for me to send this to you.

##Running
Apparently I didn't know how awful spaces in filenames were when I made this, but I'm too lazy now.

    java -jar "connect four game.jar"


##Contributing
I don't know why you'd want to, but go ahead...
